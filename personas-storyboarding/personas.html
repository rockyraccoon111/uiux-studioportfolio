            The CVS machine checkout stations substitute for human checkout stations to reduce wait times and expedite the checkout process.
                                I developed sketches of the interface and conducted interviews to produce personas and a storyboard.

            <div>
                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>First, I used Balsamiq to make some sketches representing a common flow using the CVS machine checkout station.</p>
                <video class='sketches' controls>
                    <source src="sketch_vid.mov" class="sketchvid">

            <div>
                <h3>Key Interactive Components</h3>
                <p>The sketching process helped me realize some key interactive components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initial, bright red screen indicates machine availability to potential users</li>
                    <li>Once  user begins interacting with checkout station, screen divided in 2 sections: receipt on left and available user actions on right</li>
                    <li>Once user journey is complete, machine automatically returns to initial availability state</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="mt-5 part-title" id="interviews">Part 2: Observations and Interviews</h2>
        <div class="part">
            <div>
                <h3>Observations</h3>
                <p>Before I began interviewing, I took time to observe CVS customers engaging with the checkout machines. I noticed that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers stand in line for machine checkouts even when human checkouts available</li>
                    <li>Various machine checkout issues requiring human cashier assistance (e.g. age restricted items)</li>
                    <li>Compared to human chechouts, machine checkouts are used for quicker purchases of fewer items</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
                <p>I then began interviewing customers. I asked:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why did you choose to come to this convenience store today?</li>
                    <li>How many times have you been to this CVS this past week?</li>
                    <li>Why do you use this checkout station instead of the human checkout station?</li>
                    <li>What is your favorite thing about this station?</li>
                    <li>What is your least favorite thing about this station?</li>
                    <li>What would you change about this station?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Interview Summary</h3>
                <p>From my interviews, I learned that CVS customers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go to this convenience store because it is closest to where they live (many are students)</li>
                    <li>Prefer machine checkout because believe it's faster</li>
                    <li>Like the minimal interaction with other humans (especially when buying sensitive items)</li>
                    <li>Dislike when human assistance necessary</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Paige is a freshman in college.
                    It’s her first time living away from home, and when she buys products she feels are private, she worries about bumping into people she knows.
                    Paige gets embarrassed and frustrated when the checkout machine requires the human cashier’s assistance.
                    Since this CVS sells many personal care items and is located near freshman dorms, its machine checkout stations are often used by students like Paige.

                    Hector is a graduate student.
                    Balancing his courses, research, social life, job search, and new relationship takes up a lot of his time, and he feels he’s always rushing to his next meeting.
                    Hector gets frustrated when waiting in line and when the machine takes time processing its payment.
                    Since many CVS customers are busy students who are there to purchase 1 or 2 items, there are many users like Hector who want to go through the checkout process as fast as possible.

                By representing my observations and interview responses as personas and then as a storyboard, I became a more attentive and empathetic UX designer.
